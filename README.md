# :shell: Learning Bash :shell:

In this project I will be learning various techniques to use bash for scripting.I hope to use bash to make my coding, development, and deployment in 2022 much more seemless. I use python for scripting right now, but bash is very powerful for common SRE tasks so I feel I must learn it to be proficient as a software engineer.
