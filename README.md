# :shell: Learning Bash :shell:

In this project, I will be learning several scripting techniques using bash.
I'm hoping to use bash to make my coding, development, and deployment lot more seamless and productive. I'm currently using Python for scripting, but bash is incredibly strong for common SRE jobs, therefore I believe I need to learn it to be a competent software engineer. This repository is completely script-driven.
Software engineering is totally script-based depedant and it entails one to have a broad knowledge in scripting.
